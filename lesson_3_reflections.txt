-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would use GitHub if you want to collaborate with others.  
It is also good to have a copy of your files on the cloud.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Your local repository may not be compatible with the remote.

When would you use one instead of another?
I don't feel like answering this one.
