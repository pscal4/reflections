-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, it creates a .git directory.
You need to do it to create the repository.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. 
The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores 
information about what will go into your next commit.  	
The basic Git workflow goes something like this:
1.  You modify files in your working directory.
2.  You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.
3.  You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area 
and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.
If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, it’s considered committed. 
If it’s modified but has been added to the staging area, it is staged. 
And if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is modified.
